                        <p>Enhanced internet connectivity, increased adoption of mobile devices and social media frenzy has resulted in
                            an explosion of online customer interaction. However, online commerce is in a state of ﬂux due to the
                            increased pace of technology evolution and intense competition. Several eCommerce companies today, operate
                            on wafer thin margins which necessitate them doing volume business. The business also needs strong customer
                            attraction and retention strategies. The convergence of channels calls for proactive development of systems
                            to address the challenges.</p>

                                <p>Customizing the web applications or its pages is one trend that can never fade away,
                                    as it gives what one desires in terms of the sites looks, content, graphics, etc. It
                                    is one of the best ways to harmonize well, between the new and the old ones.
                                    Customize design may not be changed regularly except for a few small alterations, as
                                    its design will be its face value. It then saves on your cost of revamping the site
                                    repeatedly. The software for the website can be designed as per the requirements and
                                    needs of the client. The customized website also helps in capturing the right
                                    audience for the website, especially, if it is an e-commerce website of a particular
                                    brand or website pertaining to educational institutes. The approach towards the
                                    website development needs to be clear from the beginning.
                                    Website designers provide various services in the custom web application development
                                    such as; its layout, source code, presentation, user-friendliness, etc., and these
                                    aspects are looked upon after the customized concept has been finalized.</p>
